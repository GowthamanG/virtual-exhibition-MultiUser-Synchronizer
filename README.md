# virtual-exhibition-MultiUser-Synchronizer
In context of my bachelor thesis at the University of Basel in Switzerland (https://dbis.dmi.unibas.ch/teaching/studentprojects/collaborative-virtual-museums/), I'm going to implement a multi-user synchronization experience in a virtual reality space created by Unity3d. 

This is the server-side repository. For the client-side go check the repository: https://github.com/GowthamanG/virtual-exhibition-presenter. 
The client-side is an existing virtual exhibition space created by the DBIS group of the University of Basel in Switzerland and is part of their research project VIRTUE. More Details about this project, go check: https://dbis.dmi.unibas.ch/research/projects/virtue/.

This is an early stage of the implementation ...
